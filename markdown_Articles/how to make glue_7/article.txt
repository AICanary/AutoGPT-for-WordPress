>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named **Ayesha** who lived in Pakistan. She was always curious and loved tinkering with things.

>One day, Ayesha decided to make her own glue. She had heard that it was possible to make glue out of some common household items, so she decided to give it a try.

>Ayesha gathered some flour, water, and **salt**. She put the flour and water into a pot and stirred it until it was a thick paste. Then she added the salt and stirred it until it was completely dissolved.

>Next, Ayesha put the pot on the stove and heated it until it started to bubble. She kept stirring it until it thickened up into a gooey consistency. When it was done, she took it off the heat and let it cool.

>When the glue was cool, Ayesha tested it out on some paper. To her delight, it worked! She was so proud of her accomplishment that she decided to give it to her friend **Zain** as a present.

>Zain was so impressed with Ayesha's homemade glue that he started to use it for all of his projects. Soon, word spread throughout the village about Ayesha's amazing glue-making skills.

>Ayesha's glue quickly became popular, and she started to make it for other people in the village. She even started to sell it, so that everyone could enjoy the benefits of her homemade glue.

>Ayesha's glue-making skills were so impressive that she was even invited to teach a class on it. Soon, she was teaching people from all over Pakistan how to make their own glue.

>Ayesha's story is a great example of how anyone can use their creativity and ingenuity to make something useful out of everyday items. It just goes to show that with a little bit of effort and imagination, anything is possible!
